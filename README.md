# Firava

Firava adapts the open source [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) typeface into a variable version.

## Features

* The typeface includes regular and italic styles.
* Currently, the typeface has a single variable axis, weight, which ranges from 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black), with a default weight of 400.
* The source version of Fira has nearly 1,700 characters. Firava is currently limited to just over 450.

## Tools

I'm using the following tools to produce Firava:
* [Glyphs 2.6.5](https://glyphsapp.com/)
* [FontLab 7](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab/)
* [Glyphhanger](https://github.com/filamentgroup/glyphhanger)
* [woff2](https://github.com/google/woff2)

I've also found Travis Kochel's [I can Variable Font](https://github.com/scribbletone/i-can-variable-font) super-helpful throughout this process.
