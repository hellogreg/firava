      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'100;">Liverpool fended off feisty FC Midtjylland 2-0 in a Champions League group stage match at Anfield on Tuesday that saw defensive platoon man Fabinho exit with a hamstring injury.</p>


      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'200;">The Brazil international had transitioned from his defensive midfielder role to centre-back to fill in for the injured Virgil van Dijk, but a knock in the 30th minute further depleted Jurgen Klopp's ranks.

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'300;">"It is exactly the last thing we needed," said Klopp, when asked after the match about the seriousness of the injury.</p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'400;">"I know [Fabinho] felt a hamstring, and that's not good. He said he could have played on but no sprints, which doesn't help. We will see, we will know more after a scan but clearly it isn't good," he added.</p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'500;">Fabinho had been filling in for Van Dijk in the centre of defence since the Dutchman suffered a serious knee injury in the Merseyside derby against Everton. Reds defender Joel Matip has also been battling injuries and did not dress for Tuesday's match.</p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'600;">Klopp brought on teenager Rhys Williams to partner Joe Gomez at the back after Fabinho's exit, and praised the youngster for his efforts.</p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'700;">"Rhys Williams he's only 19-years old and I think he's played more Champions League games than Premier League games -- that's rare. We're doing really well but its a shock for a team because now we have to sort that injury," added Klopp.</p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'800;"> Diogo Jota gave Liverpool the lead with his close-range shot in the 55th minute off Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross. The Portugal man's goal was the 10,000th across all competitions in Liverpool's illustrious history, 128 years after Jock Smith scored their first in the Lancashire League.</p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'900;">Defending Danish league champions Midtjylland, playing their first-ever road Champions League match, held their own against a rotated Liverpool side that saw Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, and Roberto Firmino make second-half appearances.</p>
